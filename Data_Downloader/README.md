# Data-Downloader
This is used to Download .xml data from the IESO Data Directory
I based the LinkFinder class from the tutorial provided buckyroberts on a python webcrawler
This code's end implementation is to be run via task scheduler on a weekly basis to store data to be analyized at a later date.
The IESO keeps some report data for a range of only 90 days thus the need for this project!
