# Hydrological Catchment Model
As part of a course on water resources engineering a project was performed in which a dam and reservior system had to be designed for a lake.
This project was done in teams of 3, the majority of the coding in this project was undertaking by myself.
Code features the implementation of a metrolpolis walker algorithm with simulated annealing for finding optimal hyperparameters.
